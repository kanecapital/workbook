## About

As many of you know, just a year ago I had a net worth of -50k in debt all for a Penn State business degree that warranted just a 60k job offer at Oracle. While Oracle is a great place to work and I understand the value of climbing your way up or paying your dues, I did not want to wait until I was 65 years old to be retired and finally “happy.”

God forbid, who knows maybe I will never make it to 65 years old. I want financial freedom now because tomorrow is uncertain.

I also have an enormous family (Italian) in Northern, NJ and we are extremely close, so moving to Boston was not really enticing to me.

I started with a $1,732.38 bond from when I was born, cashed it in early as the last $$$ I had to my name as my paid internship was cancelled due to COVID.

I declined the Oracle offer and followed my dream of being a full-time trader, since fully committing I have made over 200k this year at just 22 years old.

## Paper Trading

I began paper trading in 8th grade and in 2019 I opened an investopedia simulated game “Warren Buffett Million Dollar
Challenge”

I am currently ranked the 51st best portfolio in the world amongst 50,000+ competitors

I am up 7,711.77% or over 70M since beginning (if only it was real)

This was the original place I began to learn and see what worked for me since I had no money to start with, practice makes perfect

When transitioning to actual money it's definitely different because real money is on the line and emotions factor in, but you can very much have the same results as myself:

Year 1 (Real money): $1,732.38 → $200,000+

Use this playbook as a means of motivation, and education for all those with smaller accounts. Know you are capable of being next and creating your own financial freedom

## Trading Style

I am a day trader who focuses on purely intraday movements whether long or short in an individual trading day. I do swing “sometimes” however it is rare for me to hold things overnight unless extremely good reasoning.

This removes the “Macroeconomic” factors for me as I do not have to sweat about if my position will crash due to COVID, a global threat impacting or creating fear, treasury yields, etc. I prefer not doing this because if I have a good company, outside factors such as the ones listed above can cause my positions to still lose value and the time I spend digging into the state of the economy, company earnings, etc. I can just play intraday moves stress-free and then go about my day/life after 4pm.

Also it allows me to strive for a daily target of income instead of taking large and volatile swings in profit on days where a long term hold moves the wrong way. Everyday I can consistently strive towards my annual goal and for me I can wake up everyday with full buying power (100% opportunity cost), and a clean slate so I just judge the market for what it is that day in the morning and repeat the cycle.

I am 23 years old, although I have 200k to play with $1,000 a day is my goal. That is a ton of money for someone my age my friends make 60k a year so 1k a day is $260,000 that is plenty. I do NOT have to become a millionaire in 1 day, I take base hits and let my account grow through CONSISTENCY.

I cannot stress enough that yes 1,000% gain is awesome but it's RARE and if u do not properly scale in and out recognizing resistance and adding support then you can end up bag holding waiting for miracles.

It is better to get 5/5 on 20% than 1 100% runner and 4 25%+ losses

## Brokers

### TD Ameritrade / ThinkorSwim

I love this for charting as the layout is super clean, the indicators are so easy to use and add, plus you can have like 5 charts on just 1 monitor.

This link is awesome to get setup to use key features on TOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdySZFsiDaU

### WeBull

I love WeBull for options, they show the spreads with clear second levels. Also, they easily have the least amount of fees; it's basically $0 or unnoticeable. TDA I got crushed in options fees especially on lotto or smaller priced contracts. It's $1.30 per contract which is crazy. On a $0.04 contract you would need at least a 50% gain to even make money.

## Trading Setup

### Trade Ideas

I use this platform and I know many from Atlas recommended it to me for day trading. I use the premarket gappers list where I select a top 5 for small caps and top 5 for large caps then I run through the catalysts whether its ER, FDA approval, merger, etc. and base my stance on that to narrow it down more.
I grab 5 small, 5 large and peep the news then i put the charts up on TOS and see which I like best

### Communities

::: info
Atlas Trading / Sapphire Trading / GuruGrudens Discord
:::

Atlas got me where I am now. They have great content for small caps as well as Sapphire.
Use discords as a way to find ideas on plays, use them as attention getters rather than alert taking. Then chart a stock they mention if its at support then consider buying it using your strategy and risk tolerance.

I would love a similar room but for options so I am in the process of creating an elite team and discord to help you guys immensely for super cheap ($10/month). This will include live alerts entry and exit exactly.. Stay tuned !!

### Social Media

Social Media & Twitter is such a powerful tool these days and will only continue to be. Major influences can reach mass audiences and get their attention on certain trends, equities, memes, etc. Strength in numbers!

### News Sources:

- Any market related news https://twitter.com/DeItaone
- More in depth about state of the economy https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC
- This guy can move an equity 20% with one tweet https://twitter.com/elonmusk
- Benzinga Pro has an Audio Box that speaks live time news to you while you trade it does cost $ tho https://pro.benzinga.com/feature/squawk/
