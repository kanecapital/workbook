## Diamond Trades

### Bio

22 year old options trader. When I started my trading journey in 2018, I began day-trading penny stocks, blowing up several accounts along the way. About a year and a half ago I switched almost exclusively to options trading, which has been my passion ever since. I’m the co-host of our podcast “Trading Camp” and author of the weekly newsletter Diamonds in the Rough.

### Trading Style

I’m a momentum trader generally trading options, though I will occasionally take swing plays using both options and shares to express market views. I generate trade ideas using daily chart setups like gap fills, mean reversion trades, and range breakouts. I also use vwap, moving averages and news to make intraday trades.

Options day trader rarely swings but when I do they’re only 1-2 days. Prefer small/mid caps but will play large caps. I buy using key support/resistance levels, news, hot sectors as well.

Experience is the best teacher, and the worst experiences teach the best lessons.
