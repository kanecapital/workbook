## Getting Over PDT

Getting over PDT is the single HARDEST thing to accomplish in all of trading. I have a couple of pointers, tips, and tricks for you since I was just in your shoes only 14 months ago.
CASH ACCOUNT → A cash account will allow you to use more than just 3 day trades per week. This is essential if you want to grow more quickly.
MULTIPLE accounts → When I have just about $5,000 I created/opened 3 additional accounts (4 in total).
Margin Account on TD Ameritrade
Cash Account on TD Ameritrade
Margin Account on WeBull
Cash Account on WeBull
_I understand this is hard to manage 4 different accounts but if you have dual monitors + can trade from phone. You are basically now legally allowed to have almost unlimited day trades_
BASE HITS → I know it sucks to hear, but every dollar counts. Every $1 added is compounded on your next play, and the next one, etc. so appreciate the base hits. You do NOT have to get to $25,000 overnight
WeBull Overnight → You can buy plays at 7:50PM EST on WeBull then sell them at 4am without using a day trade. This is the best way to gain an edge on being under PDT because premarket a lot of times you can see stocks gap to highs before 90% of people are even awake. (Not just any stock obviously should have bullish sentiment behind the trade still).
Funnel Money into Account → I got a job working at DoorDash. Say I made $200/day I put $50 into my investment account. I know it may not seem like a lot but it compounds and if you stay consistent and disciplined with it, it will add up over time.
Getting over PDT is known as the hardest thing to do in trading, but I would argue that STAYING over PDT is just as difficult.
