# Watchlist

## Building a watchlist

Coming soon...

## Indices

Indices:
$SPY → Tracks the 500 largest companies in the US. Overall picture of the market. 
$QQQ → Tracks NASDAQ 100, largely tech based overall picture.
$VIX → Expectation of future volatility, basically it's a hedge or trades inversely from SPY. If Vix goes up, SPY comes down and vice versa. 
Times of great uncertainty causes expected future volatility 
Uncertainty causes fear / bearish markets (good if VIX is low) 
$IWM → Tracks the Russell 2000 Index which measures small cap performance in the US.
$AMC/$GME → I use $AMC and $GME as indexes basically that paint a picture of squeeze plays. 
If these two are hot I will go to WSB names:
$SNDL, $CLOV, $PLTR, $SPRT, $BB stocks with high short %
Staples: (One main for each major sector)
$TSLA → EV’s
$AMZN → Retail 
$AAPL → 18% of the S&P, carries the indices
$GOOGL/$FB → Tech
$MRNA → Vaccines 
$AMD + $NVDA → Semiconductors
$BABA → China
$ROKU → Consumer services 
$COIN → Bitcoin
