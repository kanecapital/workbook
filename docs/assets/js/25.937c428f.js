If it goes down you were wanting dips / cheaper shares so you’re still happy.\nALWAYS expect that your position can go to $0\nIf you have a support point drawn out on your TA, what if Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk sells? What if SPY tanks 1%? Do you think Elon Musk cares that you had a support line drawn at $707?\nAlways remember what moves prices, supply and demand - do not overthink this. If people are selling, the price will go down no matter what your chart says.\nSometimes shit stocks go up a ton in value because people at the end of the day care about ONE THING: “Will this position increase in value?”\n$AMC and $GME great examples\nFind your TRUE risk tolerance\nIf you do not do this you are doomed as a trader.\nAt what point when you see red does it start to hurt. For some that may be $100, others $1,000 and others $100,000. That pain point is your true risk tolerance.\nIf using a 20% stop and my pain point is $1,000 then do not risk more than $2,500. Why? Because let it have to be 2 red trades for your pain point to kick in not just one trade. Give yourself another chance before emotions kick in.\nALWAYS stop trading if you lose 50% of your daily goal\nIf my daily goal is $1,000 and I lose $500 I will generally stop trading. Especially if new, this is so essential so the emotions do not kick in.\nWhy? If I hit my daily goal of $1,000 on Monday but lose $500 Tuesday and stop there. I am still net gain $500 for the week. I NEVER want to set myself back 2 trading days by wiping out the entire daily gain in a day.\nThink like this instead (In the scenario where you: Win $1,000 Monday, lose $500 Tuesday) “okay so I am averaging $250/day so Monday $250 and Tuesday $250.”\nNEVER use more than 2x your daily goal as buying power for options\nDon’t get crazy, know your true risk tolerance.\nAre you going to become a millionaire tonight? No one step at a time.\n“Move the chains, get first downs, and set yourself up to score.
