One of the most common mistakes I see traders make is adding into an ugly red candle.
You can see by my 1st arrow I have identified a “supply zone” on the 1m chart where a lot of rookie scalpers will enter after that halty red candle because the shares just simply appear cheap as compared to 5 minutes before. What almost always happens after is a sideways green candle on the 1m where more shorts load and more longs get out of their positions. As you can see, followed by the first arrow in my chart below is that sideways green candle (shorts load, longs leave) and continued downtrend.</p> <p>You can see I have identified a second arrow pointing to yet another ugly red candle. This is continued by some consolidation. You see it holds the $20 psych level multiple times but knows when it tests over and over and over and over again (tested 4 times on this chart) that usually means longs get exhausted out IMO and shorts keep pushing every attempt for it to curl.</p> <p>There is a 3rd example (last arrow) of on ugly red followed by sideways green 1 candle, into more downside movement.</p> <h3 id="example-2"><a href="#example-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Example #2</h3> <p>This is $MOSY from today 09/15 which tried to hold $6 support.
You can see it tests $6 4 different times and on 2 attempts to curl it gets stuffed down to retest support. I always say if it tests 1-2 times you usually get a bounce the other way. But if it keeps testing (3-4 times) you almost always see the break which we can see based on the chart below it gives a nasty red candle to the downside</p> <h2 id="important-practices"><a href="#important-practices" class="header-anchor">#</a> Important Practices</h2> <p>Go light size on breakouts
Often see the grossest red candles from HOD test or fake breakouts
Scale in ⅓ or ¼ adds. Expect the stock to dip but if and when it does ask yourself:
“Why is it dipping? Is it holding the support level I drew?”
“Where is my next support underneath to add?”
Always think in the perspective of the opposite side. If you are long, think where would shorts come in? Where would shorts cover? If you are short, where would longs add or trap shorts?
Recognize the dead periods of the market
9:30am → 11:30am are generally profitable period for me
Lunch time is usually when FOMO, boredom, chasing occurs and you either give back gains or dig yourself in a deeper hole
The market is going NOWHERE! It was here 50 years ago and will be here in 50 years, you do not need to make up that loss at lunchtime on September 14th when SPY is down 0.70%!
Cut losers. Losses will happen, it’s okay move on.
It can ALWAYS get worse and keep moving down or upwards.
<em>Every minute you spend crying about a position that is not working, there is 10 other plays that are setting up to run 100%, 200%, 1,000% you could be reallocating your $ to</em></p> <p>Nothing goes up forever, every trend people take profits, shorts add in, etc. The odds you are in the super squeeze of the month is slim, do not bank on anything.</p> <p>The higher a stock goes, the more room it has to go down.</p> <p>If you are bored, go jerkoff or something, DO NOT gamble. It is okay to take a day off. Being neutral on the day is better than digging yourself in a hole / losing</p> <p>Everybody takes losses, even Zack Morris and Michael Jordan have missed on occasion</p> <p>If you are in just because a self-proclaimed “Guru” (like me haha) is in, do better. Understand why you or they are in and if you like it, join. Know the levels, have a PT and a stop if support breaks, etc.</p> <h2 id="blue-ball-effect"><a href="#blue-ball-effect" class="header-anchor">#</a> Blue Ball Effect</h2> <p>NEVER let a green trade turn red.
My rule is a 20% hard stop on all trades from initial entry
Once my trade moves up (green) 5% I move my stop loss up to 10% risk.
When my trade is up 10-15% I move my stop loss to entry.
This can vary on volatile options or Lotto’s but generally always stick to this rule.
NEVER buy a full position at once.
Just think: “What are the odds that I nailed the exact bottom of the day in this position?” Obviously it's extremely unlikely so ALWAYS leave room to add more.
This has a mental advantage to it (a win:win scenario) if your stock goes up you have a starter position. If it goes down you were wanting dips / cheaper shares so you’re still happy.
ALWAYS expect that your position can go to $0
If you have a support point drawn out on your TA, what if Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk sells? What if SPY tanks 1%? Do you think Elon Musk cares that you had a support line drawn at $707?
Always remember what moves prices, supply and demand - do not overthink this. If people are selling, the price will go down no matter what your chart says.
Sometimes shit stocks go up a ton in value because people at the end of the day care about ONE THING: “Will this position increase in value?”
$AMC and $GME great examples
Find your TRUE risk tolerance
If you do not do this you are doomed as a trader.
At what point when you see red does it start to hurt. For some that may be $100, others $1,000 and others $100,000. That pain point is your true risk tolerance.
If using a 20% stop and my pain point is $1,000 then do not risk more than $2,500. Why? Because let it have to be 2 red trades for your pain point to kick in not just one trade. Give yourself another chance before emotions kick in.
ALWAYS stop trading if you lose 50% of your daily goal
If my daily goal is $1,000 and I lose $500 I will generally stop trading. Especially if new, this is so essential so the emotions do not kick in.
Why? If I hit my daily goal of $1,000 on Monday but lose $500 Tuesday and stop there. I am still net gain $500 for the week. I NEVER want to set myself back 2 trading days by wiping out the entire daily gain in a day.
Think like this instead (In the scenario where you: Win $1,000 Monday, lose $500 Tuesday) “okay so I am averaging $250/day so Monday $250 and Tuesday $250.”
NEVER use more than 2x your daily goal as buying power for options
Don’t get crazy, know your true risk tolerance.
Are you going to become a millionaire tonight? No one step at a time.
“Move the chains, get first downs, and set yourself up to score. If you throw a Hail Mary and go for a TD every play you will miss drastically 9/10 times” - Coach Gruden
ALWAYS stick to your original plan for entering
Never let a scalp become a day-trade, a day-trade become a swing, etc.
If your original plan does not work IT’S OKAY! Hundreds of stocks moving 20, 30, 50, 100% as you are bag holding something in a downtrend
Opportunity Cost of you holding something that's failing can be better used in plays that are working as we speak
ALWAYS scale out at resistance levels
If I bought at support and my trade is up 20% and approaching resistance levels you will always see me scaling out and moving my stop losses up.
This is important because while hitting 200% runners with full positions is great, for me personally the base hits add up collectively to 200%+.</p> <h2 id="risk-strategies"><a href="#risk-strategies" class="header-anchor">#</a> Risk Strategies</h2> <p>Rule of 7 → You take 4 trades per day that you do not sell until 28% profit. You put a 7% stop loss on each. You only need to hit on ONE trade out of FOUR (25% win rate) in order to maintain profitability.
Proper Sizing → Use proper sizing based on the conviction in your plays
High Confidence = 7-10% of portfolio buying power (Still in scales so if I want 10% I will buy with 3.5% each scale)
Medium Confidence = 4-5% of portfolio buying power
Lotto = 1% of portfolio buying power
Super Lotto = 0.5% of portfolio buying power</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
